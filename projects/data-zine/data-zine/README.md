## Data Zine Project - Unforgettable Sentences that I Have Read

</br>

In this project, I collected data on unforgettable sentences that I have read. By saying unforgettable, I mean that I would think about these sentences after I read them, or I would mention them in the conversations I had with my friends.

</br>

I created a Google sheet to collect the data. Here is a screenshot of my Google sheet:

I would put the data of the sentences into this Google sheet once they fit in my definition of being "unforgettable".

<br/>

I collected the data of where I read these sentences, their topics, the languages of them, and why I found these sentences unforgettable. I also collected the information of the authors, including their genders and nationalities. There are some data that I collected in the Google sheet but were not used in the final outcome of my Data Zine Project, because I think they are not that useful. These data include the title of the books and essays and the purpose of reading them.

Here is the cover of my Data Zine Project:

The cover includes the basic shapes, circles, and colors that I used in the visualization.

Here is the second and third pages of my Data Zine Project:

You can see in these two pages that there are six circular paths of six different colors. Each circular path represents a reason why I found these sentences unforgettable. For instance, the white circular path in the center represents that these sentences are unforgettable because I learned new things from them.
On each circular path, there are smaller circles. Each circle represents a sentence and it includes the information of this sentence.

Here is the back of my Data Zine Project:

On the back is a detailed explanation on how to read my data visualization.

</br>

After collecting data and making this Data Zine Project, I noticed that the topics of the texts that I read and the identity of the authors (nationality) covered a wide ranges.

</br>

I made a lot of adjustments on the composition of my Data Zine Project. Previously in my paper prototype, I used squares and triangles in addition to circles. But in the final version, I mainly used circles to keep the whole project coherent. In addition, I tried numerous ways to arrange the circular paths as well. I previously wanted to use the circular paths to represent the gender of the authors and to arrange them as semicircles on the top of the second and third pages of my Data Zine. Then I realized that this arrangement would lead to a lot of extra spaces that were unused. Therefore, I changed the composition and arranged the circular paths as concentric circles that made my data visualization look like a galaxy.

</br>

If this project was not for print, I would like to add some animations to it. For instance, the small circles on the circular paths can appear one by one from the center to the edge. The circles on the white circular path can appear first, and then the circles on the red circular path, and so on. They could be rotating on a slow speed as well to look more like a galaxy. In addition, there could be some interactions as well. When the mouse hovers on a certain small circle, the animation would stop and the information contained in this small circle would appear in text. I would also have more choices for the colors. Since the project was for print, I did not use many bright colors that were not suitable for print and would look dull after being printed on paper. If this project was not for print, I would not have this limitation on the design of my Data Zine Project.
