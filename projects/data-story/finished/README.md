  - don't try to include every aspect of your project in one GIF, just **a small aspect that you think looks good** and will make people want to visit it (something that moves, e.g. a transition)
 - 2-3 sentences about the project
  - written in a style that will make people want to visit it
 - links to the source of the data you used
  - if you compiled the data yourself, describe your methodology

## The Process

- Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?
- What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?
- Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?
- If you had more time, what would you change, improve, add to the project?
