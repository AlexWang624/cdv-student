### About This Project:
 Wanna know what is happening in space? Take a look at Space Odyssey - A Glimpse into the Space Age! This is a web-based data visualization project on the technological developments during the Space Age. With data from 5 datasets, this project presents a interactive timeline of significant events in space during the Space Age and includes several visualizations on the information of orbital spaceflights.

### Datasets Used in This Project:
  - [UCS Satellite Database](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/satellite-database)
  - [Chronology of Space Launches](https://space.skyrocket.de/directories/chronology.htm)
  - [Launch Sites](https://space.skyrocket.de/directories/launchsites.htm)
  - [Chronology of Significant Events in Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Age#:~:text=The%20Space%20Age%20is%20a,continuing%20to%20the%20present%20day.)
  - GeoJSON Data for Countries in the World

### Methodology:
[UCS Satellite Database](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/satellite-database) can be downloaded in Excel format and converted to a cvs file. I used a free web scraper called [ParseHub](https://www.parsehub.com/) for scraping the data on [Chronology of Space Launches](https://space.skyrocket.de/directories/chronology.htm) and [Launch Sites](https://space.skyrocket.de/directories/launchsites.htm). For the data in [Chronology of Significant Events in Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Age#:~:text=The%20Space%20Age%20is%20a,continuing%20to%20the%20present%20day.), I directly copied and pasted them in a Google Sheets and then exported them in a json file.




## The Process

### Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?

### What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?
This project consists of
- a scrollable interactive timeline of significant technological events in space;
- a visualization of the numbers of orbital and suborbital spaceflights (as a transition to tell the audience that the following project will focus on orbital spaceflights only);
- a map of countries and regions that have launch sites for orbital spaceflights;
- a force graph on the detailed information on these launch sites;
- a bar chart of the number of orbital launches per year from 1957 to 2020;
- and another force graph on the currently operational satellites around the Earth.

I wanted to tell the story of the Space Age in detail and make my project more like a

- Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?
- If you had more time, what would you change, improve, add to the project?
