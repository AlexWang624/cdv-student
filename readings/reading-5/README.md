Among all the text and podcasts that we read and listened to this week, “The Daily The End of Privacy as we know it?” is the one that “creeped” me out the most. One detail mentioned by Kashmir Hill in the podcast left me a deep impression. When she asked a police officer to run a picture of her through Clearview’s app, the app first gave no results. Then within ten minutes, the officer received a phone call from Clearview asking why he was uploading a New York Times reporter’s photo.
Once again this podcast made me think about the importance of the transparency in the technology developed or employed by companies and law enforcement, and the insecurity risen among ordinary people towards the unclear intentions of developers of a certain technology. How do we know what “they” are doing with our data, which are generated from our privacy and our activities? Why are they able to profitize our data without acquiring the consent from the public first? Are we, as ordinary people, benefiting from a more efficient mechanism for combating criminals or are we involuntarily being controlled and manipulated? I saw a discussion on similar questions in “The Messy Truth About Social Credit” and the comments to this article. Although the social credit system provides easy and useful ways for businesses and individuals to avoid and be alert to 老赖 (laolai), it cannot be doubted that for now the system seems to be vague and some people, like me, do not understand or be aware of the existence of this system.
