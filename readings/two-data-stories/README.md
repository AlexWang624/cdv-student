## Two Data Stories

1. [Women's Pockets are Inferior](https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/)

This article compares the sizes of pockets in women's and men's jeans. It investigates the difference between the prices, textures, and sizes of jeans of different brands and styles, and it contains a visualization of the shapes and sizes of pockets.

2. [The Inside Scoop of Ben & Jerry's](https://benjerry.heshlindsdataviz.com/)

This article examines how many flavors of Ben & Jerry's ice creams exist and investigates which flavor is the most popular. It is interactive and there is a Ben & Jerry's flavor guide in which users can enter the name of the country, flavor, or addition to find information on Ben & Jerry's ice creams.

Here is another data story that I found very interesting:

[How Much does Kid Cudi Hum?](https://connorrothschild.github.io/cudi-hums/)
It measures the number of hums in Kid Cudi's songs and includes some data visualizations on the percentage of hums in each of his albums and tracks and the distribution of hums in his lyrics. Very funny, although this data story might only be interesting for people who have listened to Kid Cudi. Check this out if you like Kid Cudi's mumble rap style.
