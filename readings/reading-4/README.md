Three examples of contemporary systems/applications in which data is used to predict the future:

<b>1. Insurance industry:</b>
The first example that I thought of is the use of predictive modeling and big data in the insurance industry. I have read an article on how predictive analytics will shape the insurance industry in 2021 (https://www.duckcreek.com/blog/predictive-analyitics-reshaping-insurance-industry/). It mentions that insurance companies will collect data from both external and internal sources, such as customer interactions and telematics, to better understand and predict the future behaviors of insureds. Insurers will make use of these models to predict potential criminal intents and fraud, as well as to identify customers at risk of cancelling or lowering coverage, in order to minimize the problem of imperfect information.

<b>2. Online dating apps like Tinder:</b>
The second example is online dating apps. In this case, these applications are predicting things that sound very subjective: users’ romantic desire and their attraction to other users. Different from apps and websites that require users to fill out a questionnaire for their preferences, Tinder asks little information when the users are setting up their profiles. Previously, Tinder used a system called “El score” that was generated based on how many people swipe right for a certain user. The more people like you, the higher the El score you have, and profiles of users with similar scores will be shown more often to you. But now, according to my research, Tinder is using a new algorithm that prioritizes potential matches who are active, and active at the same time. It measures the users’ levels of engagement on Tinder and recommends potential matches based on how much you use this app.

<b>3. Ride hailing and sharing apps like Didi:</b>
I noticed that every time before I called a cab using Didi, the app would show me the approximate time that this ride would take. This prediction even includes the possibility of and time spent for traffic jams. In addition, it would match the customer with the nearest driver, show the distance between the customer and this driver, and predict approximately how long the customer should wait for the driver to arrive. The predictions require the input of the starting point and destination of the customer, and the algorithm behind these predictions will make use of data collected from previous users to predict road conditions for the future.
