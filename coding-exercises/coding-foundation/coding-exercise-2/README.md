## Coding Exercise 2

In this exercise, I created a website page of a bar chart that shows the data collected from a Google Form survey (see the survey [here](https://forms.gle/KbM9Z6tR41gWbtAq7)).

- problems: I wanted to show the average score for each smell on the right side of the bar, instead of under the bar, but I failed.
