## Coding Exercise 2 

In this exercise, I created a website page of a bar chart that shows the data collected from a Google Form survey (see the survey [here](https://forms.gle/KbM9Z6tR41gWbtAq7)).

- Problems:
1. I wanted to show the average score for each smell on the right side of the bar, instead of under the bar, but I failed.
2. I don't know how to make animation using JavaScript. I wanted to apply more effects to my bar chart, for example, the width of the bar chart will "grow" from 0 to the average score of each smell.

- Things Learned:
1. I learned how to create bar charts.
