## Coding Exercise 8

In this exercise, I created a map with a visualization of the data on the population of international students in China. To change the projection of the map, users can click the button on the top of the website page.

- Problems:
1. I wanted to create an interaction that when the users move their mouse on a province, it can show the name and population of international students in that province. However, I do not know how to create this kind of interaction.

- Things Learned:
1. I learned how to create a map with GeoJSON.
