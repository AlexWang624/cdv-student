## Coding Exercise 3

In this exercise, I created a simple visualization of the data I collected so far for the Data Zine project.

- Problems:
1. I encountered a problem with Google Sheets that it wouldn't let me export JSON files. The error message was "Exception: The number of rows in the range must be at least 1."

- Things Learned:
1. I learned how to create data visualization using D3.js.
